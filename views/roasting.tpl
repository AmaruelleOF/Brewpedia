    <h2>Roasting Coffee: A Master Class</h2>
    <p>Are you a coffee lover who wants to learn the art of coffee roasting?
        Look no further! In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into the world
        of roasting coffee beans, including techniques, equipment, and tips for
        achieving a perfect roast.</p>
    <h2>The Basics of Coffee Roasting</h2>
    <p>Roasting coffee is the process of heating green coffee beans to transform them
        into the brown, aromatic beans we all know and love. During roasting, the beans
        undergo several chemical changes that affect their flavor, aroma, and color.
        The three main stages of coffee roasting are:</p>
    <h3>1. Drying Stage</h3>
    <p>In this first stage, the coffee beans lose their moisture content and turn yellow.
        The beans will start to make a cracking sound as they heat up.</p>
    <h3>2. Browning Stage.</h3>
    <p>During this stage, the beans turn light brown and start to develop their aroma and flavor.
        The beans will continue to crack as they heat up.</p>
    <h3>3. Development Stage</h3>
    <p>In the final stage, the beans reach their desired roast level and are ready to be cooled.
        During this stage, the beans will crack again, indicating that the roasting process is complete.</p>
    <h2>Types of Coffee Roasts</h2>
    <p>There are four main types of coffee roasts, each with its own unique flavor profile:</p>
    <h3>1. Light Roast</h3>
    <p>Light roast coffee has a mild flavor and a light brown color. The beans are roasted for a short
        amount of time and have a higher acidity level.</p>
    <h3>2. Medium Roast</h3>
    <p>Medium roast coffee has a slightly darker color and a more balanced flavor. The beans are roasted for a
        longer amount of time and have a lower acidity level.</p>
    <h3>3. Dark Roast</h3>
    <p>Dark roast coffee has a bold, smoky flavor and a dark brown color.
        The beans are roasted for an extended period of time and have a low acidity level.</p>
    <h3>4. Espresso Roast</h3>
    <p>Espresso roast coffee is roasted for an even longer amount of time than dark roast coffee.
        The beans have a deep, rich flavor and a shiny, dark brown color.</p>
    <h2>Roasting Equipment</h2>
    <p>To roast coffee at home, you’ll need a few essential pieces of equipment:</p>
    <h3>1. Roasting Machine</h3>
    <p>A roasting machine is the most important piece of equipment for roasting coffee. There are several
        types of roasting machines available, including drum roasters, fluid bed roasters, and air roasters.</p>
    <h3>2. Coffee Grinder</h3>
    <p>A coffee grinder is necessary for grinding roasted coffee beans before brewing.
        Burr grinders are the best type of grinder for achieving a consistent grind.</p>
    <h3>3. Roasting Thermometer</h3>
    <p>A roasting thermometer is essential for monitoring the temperature of the coffee beans during roasting. It helps ensure that the
        beans are roasted evenly and achieve the desired roast level.</p>
    <h2>Tips for Perfect Coffee Roasting</h2>
    <p>Here are a few tips to help you achieve the perfect coffee roast:
    - Use high-quality green coffee beans for the best results.
    - Start with a small batch of beans until you get the hang of the roasting process.
    - Keep a close eye on the beans during the roasting process to avoid over-roasting.
    - Let the beans cool completely before grinding and brewing.</p>
