            Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a fruit that grows on trees in tropical climates, and they come in a variety of different varieties and flavors.

        <h2>Where do coffee beans come from?</h2>

                    Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a fruit that grows on trees in tropical climates.
                    These trees are typically found in countries near the equator, including Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.
                    The fruit, known as a coffee cherry, contains two seeds or beans, which are the part that is roasted and ground to make coffee.
                    There are two main types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta.
                    Arabica beans are generally considered to be of higher quality and have a more complex flavor profile, while Robusta beans are typically less expensive and have a stronger, more bitter taste.
                    Some other less common varieties of coffee beans include Liberica and Excelsa, which are grown in smaller quantities and are not as widely used.

        <h2>How are coffee beans processed?</h2>
        <div class="row">

                    Once the coffee cherries are harvested, the beans need to be separated from the fruit and dried.
                    There are two main methods for processing coffee beans: the dry method and the wet method.
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            The dry method, also known as the natural method, involves laying the coffee cherries out in the sun to dry for several weeks.
            During this time, the cherries are raked and turned to ensure even drying.
            Once the cherries are dry, they are hulled to remove the outer layers of fruit and parchment, leaving behind the green coffee beans.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            The wet method, also known as the washed method, involves removing the outer layers of fruit from the coffee cherries using water.
            The cherries are first pulped to remove the fruit, and then the beans are soaked in water to remove any remaining pulp.
            The beans are then dried, either in the sun or using mechanical dryers.
        </div>

        <p>
            After the beans are dried, they are sorted and graded based on their size, shape, and color.
            Higher quality beans are typically larger, denser, and more uniform in color.
        </p>

        <h2>How are coffee beans roasted?</h2>
        <p>
            Roasting is a crucial step in the coffee-making process, as it brings out the flavor and aroma of the beans.
            During the roasting process, the beans are heated to high temperatures, causing them to expand and release their oils and flavors.
            There are three main types of coffee roasts: light, medium, and dark.
            Light roasts are roasted for a shorter amount of time and have a lighter color and more acidic flavor.
            Medium roasts are roasted for slightly longer and have a more balanced flavor and aroma.
            Dark roasts are roasted for the longest amount of time and have a bold, smoky flavor with less acidity.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            In addition to the roast level, the flavor of coffee can also be influenced by the region where the beans were grown, as well as the specific variety of bean.
            Some coffee beans are known for their fruity, floral notes, while others have a more nutty or chocolatey flavor.

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Coffee beans may seem like a simple ingredient, but there is actually a lot that goes into growing, processing, and roasting them to create the perfect cup of coffee.
            Whether you prefer a light, medium, or dark roast, or are looking for a specific flavor profile, there is a coffee bean out there to suit your tastes.
            So the next time you enjoy a cup of coffee, take a moment to appreciate the journey that those beans took to get into your cup.
