        <p class="">Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, enjoyed by millions
            of people every day. But have you ever stopped to think about the beans that go into your
            cup? Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a fruit that grows on trees in tropical climates,
            and they come in a variety of different varieties and flavors. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore
            the world of coffee beans, from where they come from to how they are processed and roasted.</p>
        <h2 class="">Where do coffee beans come from?</h2>
        <div class="column-list">
            <div style="width:50%" class="column">
                <p class="">Coffee beans are actually the seeds of a
                    fruit that grows on trees in tropical climates. These trees are typically found in countries
                    near the equator, including Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. The fruit, known as a coffee
                    cherry, contains two seeds or beans, which are the part that is roasted and ground to make coffee.</p>
                <p class="">
                    There are two main types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are generally
                    considered to be of higher quality and have a more complex flavor profile, while Robusta
                    beans are typically less expensive and have a stronger, more bitter taste. Some other less
                    common varieties of coffee beans include Liberica and Excelsa, which are grown in smaller
                    quantities and are not as widely used.</p>

        <h2 class="">How are coffee beans processed?</h2>
        <div class="column-list">
            <div style="width:56.25%" class="column">
                <p class="">Once the coffee cherries are harvested, the beans need to be separated
                    from the fruit and dried. There are two main methods for processing coffee beans:
                    the dry method and the wet method.</p>
                <p class=""></p>
            </div>
            <div style="width:43.75000000000001%" class="column">
                <figure class="image">
                    <a href="Coffee%20Beans%206acd225ae6b247aba18a2841e5c148e2/Untitled%201.png">
                        <img style="width:700px" src="Coffee%20Beans%206acd225ae6b247aba18a2841e5c148e2/Untitled%201.png"/>
                    </a>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="">The dry method, also known as the natural method,
            involves laying the coffee cherries out in the sun to dry for
            several weeks. During this time, the cherries are raked and turned
            to ensure even drying. Once the cherries are dry, they are hulled
            to remove the outer layers of fruit and parchment, leaving behind
            the green coffee beans.</p>
        <figure class="callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex">
            <div style="font-size:1.5em">
                <span class="icon">ðŸ’¡</span>
            </div>
            <div style="width:100%">The wet method,
                also known as the washed method, involves
                removing the outer layers of fruit from
                the coffee cherries using water. The cherries
                are first pulped to remove the fruit, and then
                the beans are soaked in water to remove any remaining
                pulp. The beans are then dried, either in the sun or
                using mechanical dryers.</div>
        </figure>
        <p class="">After the beans are dried, they are sorted
            and graded based on their size, shape, and color.
            Higher quality beans are typically larger, denser,
            and more uniform in color.</p>
        <h2 class="">How are coffee beans roasted?</h2>
        <p class="">Roasting is a crucial step in the coffee-making process,
            as it brings out the flavor and aroma of the beans.
            During the roasting process, the beans are heated
            to high temperatures, causing them to expand and release
            their oils and flavors.</p>
        <p class="">There are three main types of coffee roasts: light, medium,
            and dark. Light roasts are roasted for a shorter amount of time and
            have a lighter color and more acidic flavor. Medium roasts are roasted
            for slightly longer and have a more balanced flavor and aroma. Dark
            roasts are roasted for the longest amount of time and have a bold, smoky flavor with less acidity.</p>
        <figure class="callout" style="white-space:pre-wrap;display:flex">
            <div style="font-size:1.5em">
                <span class="icon">ðŸ’¡</span>
            </div>
            <div style="width:100%">In addition to the roast level,
                the flavor of coffee can also be influenced by the
                region where the beans were grown, as well as the specific
                variety of bean. Some coffee beans are known for their fruity,
                floral notes, while others have a more nutty or chocolatey flavor.</div>

        <h2 class="">Final thoughts</h2>
        <blockquote class="">Coffee beans may seem like a simple ingredient,
            but there is actually a lot that goes into growing, processing,
            and roasting them to create the perfect cup of coffee. Whether you
            prefer a light, medium, or dark roast, or are looking for a specific
            flavor profile, there is a coffee bean out there to suit your tastes.
            So the next time you enjoy a cup of coffee, take a moment to appreciate
            the journey that those beans took to get into your cup.</blockquote>
